# 🚀 Video Transcription Agent - Complete Context for New Chat

## 📋 Project Summary

You have a **complete TypeScript video transcription agent** that:
- Extracts audio from MP4 files using FFmpeg
- Transcribes using Azure Speech-to-Text 
- Enhances with your GPT models (gpt-4o-transcribe, gpt-audio)
- Provides summaries, key points, topics, and sentiment analysis
- Can be deployed as Azure Container App
- Integrates with Azure AI Foundry as individual atomic actions
- Uses upload + identifier workflow for clean Azure AI Foundry integration

## 🎯 Your Azure Configuration

All configuration is now managed through environment variables. See `.env.local` file for your specific values:
- Azure subscription and resource group
- API keys and endpoints
- Model names

**Security Note**: API keys are never stored in source code - only in environment variables.

## 🎯 Current Status & Recent Major Changes

### ✅ **COMPLETED (Original):**
- Complete TypeScript transcription agent built
- Azure configuration set up
- All service integrations implemented
- CLI interface ready
- Docker configuration ready
- Deployment scripts created

### ✅ **COMPLETED (Recent Refactoring):**
- **Modular Architecture**: Refactored API server into reusable library code and individual action handlers
- **Upload + Identifier Workflow**: Clean two-step process: upload video → get uploadId → process with uploadId
- **Azure AI Foundry Actions**: Created separate OpenAPI specs for each action (upload_video, transcribe_video, health_check)
- **Removed Redundant Endpoints**: Eliminated confusing /transcribe/upload endpoint
- **Action Organization**: Proper Azure AI Foundry naming conventions (lowercase with underscores)
- **Library Structure**: Reusable utilities for auth, storage, validation, and responses
- **Moved API Server**: Relocated from examples/ to src/ as main production server

### 🔄 **CURRENT ATOMIC WORKFLOW (8 Independent Endpoints):**
1. **Upload**: `POST /upload` with video file → returns `uploadId`
2. **Extract Audio**: `POST /extract-audio` with `uploadId` → returns `audioId`
3. **Transcribe Audio**: `POST /transcribe-audio` with `audioId` → returns `rawText`
4. **Enhance Transcription**: `POST /enhance-transcription` with `text` → returns `enhancedText`
5. **Summarize Content**: `POST /summarize-content` with `text` → returns `summary`
6. **Extract Key Points**: `POST /extract-key-points` with `text` → returns `keyPoints[]`
7. **Analyze Sentiment**: `POST /analyze-sentiment` with `text` → returns `sentiment`
8. **Identify Topics**: `POST /identify-topics` with `text` → returns `topics[]`
9. **Health Check**: `GET /health` → service status

**Agent Composition**: Agents decide which endpoints to call based on user requests

### ✅ **COMPLETED (Latest - September 18, 2025):**
- **ATOMIC ARCHITECTURE IMPLEMENTED**: Confirmed that atomic actions are fully implemented with proper service separation
- **CORE LOGIC SEPARATION**: Services like UploadVideoService and ExtractAudioService are pure TypeScript classes
- **API THIN WRAPPERS**: Actions are properly implemented as thin HTTP wrappers around core services
- **PROJECT BUILT**: TypeScript compilation successful, dist/ directory populated with all atomic actions

### ❓ **PENDING TASKS:**
- ⏳ CURRENTLY TESTING: API server started, about to run test-atomic-workflow.js script
- Deploy updated service to Azure Container Apps
- Test end-to-end Azure AI Foundry integration

### 🧪 **CURRENT TESTING STATUS (September 18, 2025):**
- ✅ Test video file confirmed: test-video.mp4 exists (6.5MB)
- ✅ Test script updated to use local video file
- ✅ API server starting in background on port 3000
- ⏳ About to test all 8 atomic endpoints with complete workflow

## 🤖 **IMPORTANT ARCHITECTURAL DISCUSSION**

### Current Approach vs. Agentic Approach

**CURRENT**: Monolithic actions
- `upload_video()` → uploadId
- `transcribe_video(uploadId)` → does everything (audio extraction + transcription + enhancement + analysis)

**PROPOSED**: Atomic operations for better agent composition
- `upload_video(file)` → uploadId
- `extract_audio(uploadId)` → audioId  
- `transcribe_audio(audioId)` → rawText
- `enhance_transcription(text)` → enhancedText
- `summarize_content(text)` → summary
- `extract_key_points(text)` → keyPoints[]
- `analyze_sentiment(text)` → sentiment
- `identify_topics(text)` → topics[]

**BENEFIT**: Agent decides workflow based on user request:
- "Just transcribe" → upload + transcribe_audio
- "Transcribe and summarize" → upload + transcribe_audio + summarize_content  
- "Full analysis" → upload + transcribe_audio + enhance_transcription + summarize_content + extract_key_points + analyze_sentiment

**FOLDER STRUCTURE CONCERN**: User noted that the current action folder structure (upload_video/, transcribe_video/, etc.) is too complex. Need simpler approach.

**CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL ISSUE**: The entire flow and structure needs to be rethought. The business logic should be in standalone classes that can be called directly, not mixed with API concerns. The API should be just a thin wrapper.

## 🏗️ **CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL RETHINK NEEDED**

### **Current Problem:**
The business logic is mixed into API action handlers, making it impossible to reuse for other interfaces.

### **Desired Architecture:**
```
Core Logic Classes (Pure TypeScript - No API Dependencies)
├── UploadVideoService.ts      # Handle file uploads, return identifiers
├── TranscribeVideoService.ts  # Process video transcription 
├── ExtractAudioService.ts     # Audio extraction logic
├── SummarizeContentService.ts # Content summarization
├── etc.

Interface Wrappers (Thin layers that call core logic)
├── API Server (Express)       # HTTP wrapper → calls core services
├── MCP Server (future)        # MCP wrapper → calls same core services  
├── CLI Interface              # Command line → calls same core services
├── Direct Import              # TypeScript import → calls same core services
```

### **Benefits:**
- **Reusable Logic**: Same core services work for API, MCP, CLI, direct imports
- **Testable**: Can unit test core logic without HTTP concerns
- **Flexible**: Easy to add new interfaces (GraphQL, gRPC, etc.)
- **Clean Separation**: Business logic separate from transport layer

### **Example Usage:**
```typescript
// Direct usage (for MCP server, etc.)
const uploadService = new UploadVideoService();
const transcribeService = new TranscribeVideoService();

const uploadId = await uploadService.storeVideo(videoFile);
const result = await transcribeService.process(uploadId);

// API usage (thin wrapper)
app.post('/upload', (req, res) => {
  const result = await uploadService.storeVideo(req.file);
  res.json(result);
});
```

## 📝 **CURRENT TODO LIST**

### **CRITICAL - Architectural Restructure** ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **Separate core logic from API concerns** - ✅ DONE: Pure TypeScript service classes implemented
- [x] **Create core service classes** - ✅ DONE: UploadVideoService, ExtractAudioService, etc. implemented
- [x] **Make API server a thin wrapper** - ✅ DONE: Actions are thin HTTP wrappers calling core services
- [x] **Design for multiple interfaces** - ✅ DONE: Services can be used by API, CLI, MCP server, direct imports

### High Priority  
- [x] **Fix absurd folder structure** - ✅ DONE: Actions are flat files (upload-video.ts, extract-audio.ts, etc.)
- [ ] **Test atomic workflow locally** - ⏳ IN PROGRESS: About to test with test-atomic-workflow.js
- [x] **Decide on atomic vs monolithic service approach** - ✅ DONE: Atomic approach implemented with 8 endpoints
- [ ] **Create Azure AI Foundry actions** - Use detailed setup instructions from container-app-setup.md

### Medium Priority  
- [ ] **Test end-to-end Azure AI Foundry integration** - Validate actions work in AI Foundry
- [ ] **Update function schemas** - Ensure OpenAPI specs match implementation
- [ ] **Test with various video formats/URLs** - Robustness validation

### Architecture Decisions Needed
- [ ] **Action granularity**: Atomic operations vs current monolithic approach
- [ ] **Folder structure**: Flat files vs current nested folders vs something simpler
- [ ] **Legacy code cleanup**: Keep transcription-agent.ts or replace with new processor

## 🧪 Immediate Next Steps (Testing Phase)

### 1. Local Testing First
```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Test configuration
node dist/index.js config

# Test Azure connectivity  
node dist/index.js status

# Test agent integration
npm run test-agent

# Test CLI with a video file
node dist/index.js transcribe ./your-video.mp4 --enhance
```

### 2. Test NEW Upload + Transcribe Workflow
```bash
# Start API server
npm run api-server

# In another terminal, test new workflow:

# 1. Health check
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# 2. Upload video (get uploadId)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/upload \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key" \
  -F "video=@./test-video.mp4"

# 3. Transcribe using uploadId (replace with actual uploadId from step 2)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/transcribe \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key" \
  -d '{"uploadId": "your-upload-id-here", "enhance": true}'

# 4. Test async transcription
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/transcribe/async \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key" \
  -d '{"uploadId": "your-upload-id-here", "callbackUrl": "http://example.com/callback"}'

# 5. View API documentation
curl http://localhost:3000/docs
```

## 🐳 Container Deployment (After Testing)

### Option A: Azure Cloud Build (No Docker needed locally)
```bash
# Deploy using Azure CLI (builds container in cloud)
./deployment/deploy-to-azure.sh
```

### Option B: Install Docker Desktop
- Download from https://docker.com/products/docker-desktop
- Then run the deployment script

## 🤖 Azure AI Foundry Agent Creation & Action Setup

### Actions Required
You need to add **3 separate actions** to your Azure AI Foundry agent:

1. **Upload Video** - Users upload video files and get upload IDs
2. **Transcribe Video** - Process uploaded videos using upload IDs  
3. **Health Check** - Check service status

### Complete Setup Instructions
📋 **See `azure-ai-foundry/action-setup-guide.md` for detailed step-by-step instructions**

This guide covers:
- Exact Azure AI Foundry navigation steps
- Configuration for each of the 3 actions
- OpenAPI schema setup (using files from `openapi-specs/` folder)
- Managed Identity authentication setup
- Testing and troubleshooting

### Quick Reference
- **Container App URL**: `https://video-transcribe-api.calmocean-ce622c12.eastus2.azurecontainerapps.io`
- **Authentication**: Managed Identity (automatically handled by Azure AI Foundry)
- **OpenAPI Specs**: Located in `azure-ai-foundry/openapi-specs/` folder
- **Model**: `gpt-4o-transcribe`

### Expected Workflow
```
User uploads video → Agent calls upload_video → gets uploadId → Agent calls transcribe_video → presents results
```

## 📝 Key Commands

```bash
# Development
npm install
npm run build
npm run dev

# Testing
npm run test-agent
node test-local.js
node dist/index.js config
node dist/index.js status

# CLI Usage
node dist/index.js transcribe video.mp4 --enhance
node dist/index.js transcribe video.mp4 --format json -o ./output

# API Server
npm run api-server
npm run autonomous

# Deployment
./deployment/deploy-to-azure.sh
```

## 🎬 Test Video Needed

You'll need an MP4 video file to test transcription. Options:
1. Record 30-60 seconds with your phone saying: "This is a test video for my transcription agent. Today is [date]. Testing Azure AI transcription service."
2. Use any existing MP4 video with clear speech
3. Download a sample video online

## 🔧 Environment Requirements

- Node.js 18+ ✅
- Azure CLI ✅
- npm dependencies (run `npm install`)
- For deployment: Docker Desktop OR use Azure cloud build

## 🎯 Final Goal

A working video transcription agent where:
1. Users upload/specify MP4 videos
2. Agent extracts audio and transcribes
3. AI enhances with summaries, key points, topics, sentiment
4. Results returned in structured format
5. Accessible through Azure AI Foundry chat interface

## 🆘 If You Run Into Issues

1. **Build fails**: Check Node.js version, run `npm install`
2. **Azure connection fails**: Verify API key and endpoints in config
3. **Transcription fails**: Test with shorter video, check Azure Speech service
4. **Deployment fails**: Use Azure cloud build option instead of local Docker

## **Video Transcription Agent - Continue from Modular Refactoring**

I have a **TypeScript video transcription agent** for Azure AI Foundry that has been significantly refactored into a modular architecture. The project is located at `C:\code\iamandycohen\video-transcribe`.

### **What We Just Completed:**
- ✅ **Modular Architecture**: Refactored API server into reusable library code and individual action handlers
- ✅ **Upload + Identifier Workflow**: Clean two-step process (upload → get uploadId → process with uploadId)
- ✅ **Azure AI Foundry Actions**: Created separate OpenAPI specs for each action (upload_video, transcribe_video, health_check)
- ✅ **Removed Redundant Endpoints**: Eliminated confusing /transcribe/upload endpoint
- ✅ **Moved API Server**: From examples/ to src/ as main production server
- ✅ **Library Structure**: Reusable utilities for auth, storage, validation, and responses

### **Current Architecture:**
```
POST /upload → uploadId
POST /transcribe (uploadId) → transcription results  
POST /transcribe/async (uploadId + callback) → background processing
GET /health → service status
```

### **Immediate Priorities:**
1. **CRITICAL: Architectural restructure** - Separate core logic from API concerns
2. **Test upload + transcribe workflow locally** (current state)
3. **Decide on atomic vs monolithic service approach** (user wants agentic composition)
4. **Fix absurd nested folder structure** (should be flat files, not folders with one file each)
5. **Deploy and test Azure AI Foundry integration**

### **Key Discussion Points:**

**1. Core Logic Separation (CRITICAL):**
- Current: Business logic mixed into API action handlers
- Needed: Pure TypeScript service classes that can be called directly
- Goal: Same logic usable for API, future MCP server, CLI, direct imports
- Example: API should just be thin wrapper calling `UploadVideoService.storeVideo()`

**2. Atomic Operations for Agent Composition:**
- Current: `transcribe_video(uploadId)` does everything  
- Proposed: `upload_video()`, `extract_audio()`, `transcribe_audio()`, `enhance_transcription()`, `summarize_content()`, etc.
- Benefit: Agent decides workflow based on user request

### **What I Need Help With:**
Please read `HANDOFF-CONTEXT.md` for full details, then help me:
1. **CRITICAL: Restructure architecture** - Separate core business logic from API concerns into pure TypeScript service classes
2. **Test current upload + transcribe workflow** - Validate what we have works
3. **Decide on atomic vs monolithic service approach** - For better agent composition  
4. **Fix absurd nested folder structure** - Should be flat files: actions/upload-video.ts, not actions/upload_video/upload-action.ts
5. **Deploy and test end-to-end integration**

The project has working functionality but needs architectural restructuring before proceeding. All Azure config is set up and basic transcription works.
