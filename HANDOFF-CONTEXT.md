## 🤖 **IMPORTANT ARCHITECTURAL DISCUSSION**

### Current Approach vs. Agentic Approach

**CURRENT**: Monolithic actions
- `upload_video()` → uploadId
- `transcribe_video(uploadId)` → does everything (audio extraction + transcription + enhancement + analysis)

**PROPOSED**: Atomic operations for better agent composition
- `upload_video(file)` → uploadId
- `extract_audio(uploadId)` → audioId  
- `transcribe_audio(audioId)` → rawText
- `enhance_transcription(text)` → enhancedText
- `summarize_content(text)` → summary
- `extract_key_points(text)` → keyPoints[]
- `analyze_sentiment(text)` → sentiment
- `identify_topics(text)` → topics[]

**BENEFIT**: Agent decides workflow based on user request:
- "Just transcribe" → upload + transcribe_audio
- "Transcribe and summarize" → upload + transcribe_audio + summarize_content  
- "Full analysis" → upload + transcribe_audio + enhance_transcription + summarize_content + extract_key_points + analyze_sentiment

**FOLDER STRUCTURE CONCERN**: User noted that the current action folder structure (upload_video/, transcribe_video/, etc.) is too complex. Need simpler approach.

**CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL ISSUE**: The entire flow and structure needs to be rethought. The business logic should be in standalone classes that can be called directly, not mixed with API concerns. The API should be just a thin wrapper.

## 🏗️ **CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL RETHINK NEEDED**

### **Current Problem:**
The business logic is mixed into API action handlers, making it impossible to reuse for other interfaces.

### **Desired Architecture:**
```
Core Logic Classes (Pure TypeScript - No API Dependencies)
├── UploadVideoService.ts      # Handle file uploads, return identifiers
├── TranscribeVideoService.ts  # Process video transcription 
├── ExtractAudioService.ts     # Audio extraction logic
├── SummarizeContentService.ts # Content summarization
├── etc.

Interface Wrappers (Thin layers that call core logic)
├── API Server (Express)       # HTTP wrapper → calls core services
├── MCP Server (future)        # MCP wrapper → calls same core services  
├── CLI Interface              # Command line → calls same core services
├── Direct Import              # TypeScript import → calls same core services
```

### **Benefits:**
- **Reusable Logic**: Same core services work for API, MCP, CLI, direct imports
- **Testable**: Can unit test core logic without HTTP concerns
- **Flexible**: Easy to add new interfaces (GraphQL, gRPC, etc.)
- **Clean Separation**: Business logic separate from transport layer

### **Example Usage:**
```typescript
// Direct usage (for MCP server, etc.)
const uploadService = new UploadVideoService();
const transcribeService = new TranscribeVideoService();

const uploadId = await uploadService.storeVideo(videoFile);
const result = await transcribeService.process(uploadId);

// API usage (thin wrapper)
app.post('/upload', (req, res) => {
  const result = await uploadService.storeVideo(req.file);
  res.json(result);
});
```

- Then run the deployment script

## 🤖 Azure AI Foundry Agent Creation & Action Setup

### Actions Required
You need to add **3 separate actions** to your Azure AI Foundry agent:

1. **Upload Video** - Users upload video files and get upload IDs
2. **Transcribe Video** - Process uploaded videos using upload IDs  
3. **Health Check** - Check service status

### Complete Setup Instructions
📋 **See `azure-ai-foundry/action-setup-guide.md` for detailed step-by-step instructions**

This guide covers:
- Exact Azure AI Foundry navigation steps
- Configuration for each of the 3 actions
- OpenAPI schema setup (using files from `openapi-specs/` folder)
- Managed Identity authentication setup
- Testing and troubleshooting

### Quick Reference
- **Container App URL**: `https://video-transcribe-api.calmocean-ce622c12.eastus2.azurecontainerapps.io`
- **Authentication**: Managed Identity (automatically handled by Azure AI Foundry)
- **OpenAPI Specs**: Located in `azure-ai-foundry/openapi-specs/` folder
- **Model**: `gpt-4o-transcribe`

### Expected Workflow
```
User uploads video → Agent calls upload_video → gets uploadId → Agent calls transcribe_video → presents results
```

## 📝 Key Commands

```bash
# Development
npm install
npm run build
npm run dev

# Testing
npm run test-agent
node test-local.js
node dist/index.js config
node dist/index.js status

# CLI Usage
node dist/index.js transcribe video.mp4 --enhance
node dist/index.js transcribe video.mp4 --format json -o ./output

# API Server
npm run api-server
npm run autonomous

# Deployment
./deployment/deploy-to-azure.sh
```

## 🎬 Test Video Needed

You'll need an MP4 video file to test transcription. Options:
1. Record 30-60 seconds with your phone saying: "This is a test video for my transcription agent. Today is [date]. Testing Azure AI transcription service."
2. Use any existing MP4 video with clear speech
3. Download a sample video online

## 🔧 Environment Requirements

- Node.js 18+ ✅
- Azure CLI ✅
- npm dependencies (run `npm install`)
- For deployment: Docker Desktop OR use Azure cloud build
- **Shell Environment**: PowerShell (default) - use PowerShell-compatible commands in chat

## 🎯 Final Goal

A working video transcription agent where:
1. Users upload/specify MP4 videos
2. Agent extracts audio and transcribes
3. AI enhances with summaries, key points, topics, sentiment
4. Results returned in structured format
5. Accessible through Azure AI Foundry chat interface

## 🆘 If You Run Into Issues

1. **Build fails**: Check Node.js version, run `npm install`
2. **Azure connection fails**: Verify API key and endpoints in config
3. **Transcription fails**: Test with shorter video, check Azure Speech service
4. **Deployment fails**: Use Azure cloud build option instead of local Docker

- ✅ **End-to-End Testing**: Complete workflow validated with cleanup verification
- ✅ **Space Management**: No temporary files accumulate, ~6.7MB freed per workflow

## 💡 **What to Focus On:**
The system is undergoing **major architectural refactoring to stateless agent architecture**. The current working system (100% complete with cleanup) is being converted to support agent-managed shared state with pass-by-reference file handling. Focus on completing the big bang refactor, then deploy to Azure AI Foundry with the new stateless design.

## 🧹 **WORKFLOW CLEANUP DETAILS:**
- **Cascade Pattern**: Each step cleans up the previous step's files
- **Video → Audio**: After successful audio extraction, video file is automatically deleted
- **Audio → Text**: After successful transcription, audio file is automatically deleted  
- **Space Efficient**: Typical workflow frees ~6.7MB (6.5MB video + 160KB audio)
- **No Accumulation**: Zero temporary files remain after workflow completion
- **Error Handling**: Cleanup only happens after successful operations
- **Cleanup Info**: Each response includes cleanup results (`cleanup.success`, `cleanup.spaceFreed`)

## 📋 **SAMPLE WORKFLOW INPUTS/OUTPUTS:**

### Input Chain:
1. `{"url": "https://example.com/video.mp4"}` → `uploadId`
2. `{"uploadId": "abc123"}` → `audioId` + cleanup video
3. `{"audioId": "audio_abc123_123456"}` → `rawText` + cleanup audio
4. `{"text": "transcribed text"}` → enhanced analysis

### Complete I/O Example:
```json
// Step 1: Upload
POST /upload {"url": "https://..."}
→ {"uploadId": "7ef4c181-b395-4a89-8a78-e367b8963d5d"}

// Step 2: Extract Audio + Cleanup Video
POST /extract-audio {"uploadId": "7ef4c181-b395-4a89-8a78-e367b8963d5d"}
→ {"audioId": "audio_7ef4c181-b395-4a89-8a78-e367b8963d5d_1758200262381", 
   "cleanup": {"success": true, "spaceFreed": 6516900}}

// Step 3: Transcribe + Cleanup Audio  
POST /transcribe-audio {"audioId": "audio_7ef4c181-b395-4a89-8a78-e367b8963d5d_1758200262381"}
→ {"rawText": "Short video to test transcription.", 
   "cleanup": {"success": true, "spaceFreed": 159822}}

// Steps 4-8: Text Analysis (no cleanup needed)
POST /enhance-transcription {"text": "Short video to test transcription."}
POST /summarize-content {"text": "Short video to test transcription."}
POST /extract-key-points {"text": "Short video to test transcription."}
POST /analyze-sentiment {"text": "Short video to test transcription."}
POST /identify-topics {"text": "Short video to test transcription."}
```

## 🚧 **CURRENT REFACTORING TASKS:**

### **✅ COMPLETED:**
1. **AgentStateStore**: Text file-based workflow state management
2. **ReferenceService**: Pass-by-reference file handling with temp URLs
3. **ServiceManager**: Updated to include new stateless services

### **✅ COMPLETED:**
4. **Tool Refactoring**: All 8 atomic tools converted to stateless approach
   - New signatures: `{ workflow_id }` → `{ success, workflow_id, reference_id, next_action }`
   - State retrieval: Tools pull everything needed from AgentStateStore using workflow_id
   - Error handling: Clear error messages with next best actions when state is missing
5. **API Signature Simplified**: All endpoints only need workflow_id (except upload which needs source_url)
6. **Stateless API Server**: Complete server with new architecture (port 3001)

### **✅ COMPLETED:**
7. **End-to-End Testing**: ✅ Complete stateless workflow validated successfully with test-stateless-workflow.js
8. **OpenAPI Specifications**: ✅ All 8 atomic operations documented for Azure AI Foundry

### **⏳ NEXT:**
9. **Azure Deployment**: Deploy to Container Apps using deployment scripts
10. **Azure AI Foundry Configuration**: Create actions using OpenAPI specs

### **🎯 CURRENT FOCUS:**
Deploy the tested stateless architecture to Azure and configure Azure AI Foundry actions with the new agent-friendly design.

# 🚀 Video Transcription Agent - **STATELESS ARCHITECTURE COMPLETE** ✅

I have a **TypeScript video transcription agent** for Azure AI Foundry with **completed stateless architecture refactor**. All tools now use agent-managed shared state with pass-by-reference file handling. The project is located at `C:\code\video-transcribe`.

## 🎯 **CURRENT STATUS: READY FOR TESTING**

**✅ COMPLETED BIG BANG REFACTOR:**
- **AgentStateStore**: Text file-based workflow state management  
- **ReferenceService**: Pass-by-reference file handling
- **8 Stateless Tools**: All tools only need `workflow_id`, pull everything from shared state
- **Enhanced Error Messages**: Helpful errors with next best actions
- **New API Server**: `api-server-stateless.ts` on port 3001

## 🧪 **NEXT STEPS:**
1. **Test the stateless workflow** using `test-stateless-workflow.js`
2. **Deploy to Azure AI Foundry** with new agent-friendly architecture

## 📁 **Key Files:**
- **Environment**: `.env.local` has Azure credentials
- **Test Script**: `test-stateless-workflow.js` - validates new workflow
- **API Key**: `Co4PrWyo4hj1ALpNWAiKdtBvBAJ67n`
- **Build**: `npm run build` 
- **Run New Server**: `npm run api-server-stateless` (port 3001)

## 🔄 **Simplified Workflow:**
```bash
POST /workflow → { workflow_id }
POST /upload-video { source_url, workflow_id } → { video_reference }
POST /extract-audio { workflow_id } → { audio_reference } + cleanup
POST /transcribe-audio { workflow_id } → { raw_text } + cleanup  
POST /enhance-transcription { workflow_id } → { enhanced_text }
# Analysis endpoints all just need { workflow_id }
```

**Ready for Azure AI Foundry deployment! Stateless architecture complete and tested.** 🚀
