## 📋 Project Summary

**Production-ready TypeScript video transcription agent** for Azure AI Foundry:
- Extracts audio from MP4 files using FFmpeg
- Transcribes using Azure Speech-to-Text 
- Enhances with GPT models (gpt-4o-transcribe, gpt-4o)
- Provides summaries, key points, topics, and sentiment analysis
- Deployed as Azure Container App with CI/CD pipeline
- Integrates with Azure AI Foundry as individual atomic actions
- Stateless agent-driven architecture with automatic cleanup

## 🎯 **CURRENT STATUS: PRODUCTION READY** ✅

### ✅ **LATEST IMPROVEMENTS** (September 18, 2025)
- **🔧 Security Hardened**: Removed all hardcoded secrets and model references from code
- **🔒 Documentation Cleaned**: Removed API keys and sensitive data from HANDOFF-CONTEXT.md
- **🔧 Configuration Fixed**: Updated GPT_AUDIO_MODEL from `gpt-4o-text` to `gpt-4o`
- **✅ CI/CD Pipeline Complete**: GitHub Actions with versioning, secrets, and Azure deployment
- **✅ Architecture Perfected**: Stateless, concurrent-safe, agent-driven design
- **✅ All Tests Passing**: 8/8 atomic operations working with automatic cleanup

### 🏗️ **CURRENT ARCHITECTURE:**
```
🔄 ATOMIC WORKFLOW (8 Independent Endpoints):
1. POST /upload → uploadId
2. POST /extract-audio → audioId + cleanup video
3. POST /transcribe-audio → rawText + cleanup audio  
4. POST /enhance-transcription → enhancedText
5. POST /summarize-content → summary
6. POST /extract-key-points → keyPoints[]
7. POST /analyze-sentiment → sentiment
8. POST /identify-topics → topics[]
9. GET /health → service status

🤖 Agent Composition: Agents decide which endpoints to call based on user requests
```

### 📊 **DEPLOYMENT STATUS:**
- ✅ **Azure Container Apps**: Deployed and operational
- ✅ **Azure AI Foundry**: Agent configured with X-API-Key authentication
- ✅ **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions with semantic versioning and automated deployment
- ✅ **TypeScript Build**: 0 compilation errors, all services operational
- ✅ **End-to-End Testing**: Complete workflow validated successfully
- ✅ **Security**: All secrets in environment variables, no hardcoded values

## 📁 **Key Project Files:**

### **Configuration & Environment:**
- **`.env.local`**: All Azure credentials and API keys (never committed)
- **`src/config/azure-config.ts`**: Environment-based configuration with fallbacks
- **`docs/GITHUB-SETUP.md`**: Complete guide for GitHub repository secrets
- **`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`**: Automated CI/CD pipeline

### **Core Services:**
- **`src/api-server-stateless.ts`**: Main production API server (port 3000)
- **`src/actions/`**: 8 atomic action endpoints (thin HTTP wrappers)
- **`src/services/`**: Core business logic services
- **`src/version.ts`**: Centralized version management for CI/CD

### **Testing & Development:**
- **`test-stateless-workflow.js`**: End-to-end workflow validation
- **`test-video.mp4`**: Sample video for testing

## 🎯 **PERFECTED WORKFLOW STATE SCHEMA:**

**✅ CLEAN STRUCTURE (Agent-Driven):**
```json
{
  "workflow_id": "uuid",
  "created_at": "timestamp",
  "last_updated": "timestamp", 
  "steps": {
    "upload_video": { "status": "completed", "processing_time": 3111, "result": {...} },
    "extract_audio": { "status": "completed", "processing_time": 325, "result": {...} },
    "transcribe_audio": { "status": "completed", "processing_time": 1368, "result": {...} },
    "enhance_transcription": { "status": "completed", "processing_time": 5033, "result": {...} }
  },
  "completed_steps": 4,
  "failed_steps": 0,
  "total_processing_time": 9837
}
```

**🚫 REMOVED ARTIFICIAL STATE:**
- ❌ `total_steps: 0` - Meaningless in agent-driven system
- ❌ `overall_status: "processing"` - Misleading concept
- ❌ `current_step: "..."` - Race conditions with concurrent execution

## 🔧 **Key Commands:**

```bash
# Development
npm install && npm run build
npm run api-server                    # Start production server (port 3000)

# Testing
node test-stateless-workflow.js       # End-to-end workflow test

# Deployment
./deployment/deploy-to-azure.sh       # Manual Azure deployment
# OR use GitHub Actions for automated deployment

# Version Management
npm run version:patch                 # Increment patch version
npm run version:minor                 # Increment minor version  
npm run version:major                 # Increment major version
```

## 🚀 **CI/CD & GitHub Setup:**

### **Required GitHub Secrets (13 total):**
All secrets documented in `docs/GITHUB-SETUP.md` with step-by-step Azure Service Principal setup:

1. **Azure Credentials**: `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` (Service Principal JSON)
2. **Azure Resource Info**: `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`, `AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP`, `ACR_NAME`, `CONTAINER_APP_NAME`
3. **API Keys**: `AZURE_API_KEY`, `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`, `API_KEY`
4. **Endpoints**: `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_AI_SERVICES_ENDPOINT`
5. **Models**: `GPT_TRANSCRIBE_MODEL`, `GPT_AUDIO_MODEL`
6. **Environment**: `ENVIRONMENT`

### **Deployment Process:**
1. **Local Development**: Use `deploy-to-azure.sh` for manual pushes
2. **Production**: GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline automatically builds, tests, and deploys
3. **Versioning**: Semantic versioning with automatic image tagging and GitHub releases

## 🎯 **Azure AI Foundry Integration:**

### **OpenAPI Specifications:**
Located in `azure-ai-foundry/openapi-specs/` - all 8 atomic operations documented with X-API-Key security.

### **Expected Agent Workflow:**
```
User uploads video → Agent calls upload_video → gets uploadId → 
Agent calls extract_audio → gets audioId → Agent calls transcribe_audio → 
gets rawText → Agent calls text analysis endpoints → presents results
```

## 🧹 **Automatic Cleanup:**
- **Cascade Pattern**: Each step cleans up previous step's files
- **Video → Audio**: After audio extraction, video file deleted (saves ~6.5MB)
- **Audio → Text**: After transcription, audio file deleted (saves ~160KB)
- **Zero Accumulation**: No temporary files remain after workflow completion

## 📋 **CURRENT PRIORITIES:**

### ✅ **COMPLETED:**
- ✅ **Security Hardening**: Removed all hardcoded secrets and model references
- ✅ **CI/CD Pipeline**: Complete GitHub Actions workflow with Azure deployment
- ✅ **Architecture Perfection**: Stateless, concurrent-safe, agent-driven design
- ✅ **Production Deployment**: Azure Container Apps operational
- ✅ **Azure AI Foundry**: Agent configured and working
- ✅ **Documentation Security**: Cleaned up HANDOFF-CONTEXT.md, removed all secrets

### 🎯 **REMAINING (Optional):**
1. **Documentation Updates**: Update README.md to reflect perfected architecture
2. **Performance Testing**: Validate various video scenarios and load testing
3. **User Experience**: Test edge cases through Azure AI Foundry interface

## 🚀 **HANDOFF PROMPT FOR NEW CHAT:**
